# employee-turnover-analysis
Exploratory data analysis of employee turnover using SQL, Python, and Tableau to identify retention patterns.

The analysis answers:
- Which departments have the highest turnover?
- How does tenure, age, and education relate to attrition?
- What factors can be used to guide retention strategies?

# Tools Used
- **SQL** – Data cleaning and aggregation  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** – Exploratory data analysis and visualizations  


---

# Key Insights
- Turnover is highest among employees with < 2 years of tenure.  
- Sales and Customer Support departments show the largest attrition rates.  
- Younger employees (under 30) and those with lower education levels are more likely to leave.

# Files
- **employee_data.csv** – synthetic HR dataset  
- **turnover_queries.sql** – SQL queries for turnover metrics  
- **turnover_analysis.ipynb** – Python notebook with data exploration.

# Next Steps
- Add predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression to predict turnover risk).  
- Expand dashboard with department drilldowns and trend comparisons.  
- Apply feature engineering to explore additional factors influencing attrition.
